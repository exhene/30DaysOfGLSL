# 30DaysOfGLSL

GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) is a high-level shading language that is used in conjunction with the OpenGL graphics API to create shaders for rendering 3D graphics. GLSL is a C-like language that enables developers to write custom shaders for use in OpenGL-based applications. Shaders are used to specify how the surfaces of 3D objects are rendered by defining the colors, textures, and lighting properties of each pixel. GLSL shaders are executed on the graphics processing unit (GPU) and are optimized for parallel execution, enabling real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. GLSL supports a wide range of operations, including arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations, as well as functions for working with vectors, matrices, and textures. With GLSL, developers have a powerful toolset for creating custom shaders that can enhance the realism and visual quality of 3D graphics in games, simulations, and other applications.
